# scentsible
**For the sustainability and scent-conscious consumer** <br/>
Created by Ha Nguyen <br/>

## About
Ever wonder just how heavily-fragranced a product is or what it might smell like ***before*** you buy it? This is the place for scent-conscious consumers to rate products, help make informed buying decisions because everyone has a different scent preference andâ€¦ ultimately reduce the amount of personal care product waste produced each year.
